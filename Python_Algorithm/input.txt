Mask shortage is caused by the Corona virus in China
One person came to the police station and left 500 masks and the police kept giving their voices
But the man got out fast
See what the police did then?

Watch Fully Guys..üôå

North Korea when the whole world population is dead and they‚Äôre okay because they associate with no one #Coronarivus #coronovirusoutbreak #Coronarivus

This masks are helpful for prevention against attack by Corona virus #Coronarivus

Confiscated phones, now the question is what was on those phones! To take that many phones and have no word of it to travel on the internet or have people warning others that they are taking phones is impressive...China's intranet is a shepherd's crook.

So when are yall gonna realize that a shit ton of people cant spell coronavirus 

#coronarovirus #Coronarivus

The Chinese People‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äòs 813-bed #Coronarivus field hospital commences operations tomorrow. It was built in 10 days in Wuhan. 

Yes, 10 days!

#CCP-funded groups used masks as a stunt, asking ppl to provide unnecessary information like identity card & social security number. Worse still, their masks are thinner than toilet papers. It's immoral that #Beijing is still obsessed with political infiltration amid #Coronarivus

I don't know what's scarier:

That the Corona Virus has spread to the Northeast (Boston) or that SO MANY people can't spell, they got #Coronarivus trending.

Can we at least get the correct spelling of this dangerous disease to trend instead? #CoronaVirus
